This repository is used to give the code for the 2023-2024 MAVLink-Vulnerability Detection Senior Design project for Stevens Institute of Technology
The following is a quick explanation of each file with the purpose of the code and an explanation on how to run the code.

Attack.pcapng - This .pcapng file is a caputre of a simulated drone running in MAVLink when an attack occurs on it, causing the drone to crash. This was captured using Wireshark and can be viewed using the same program.

HeartbeatMessageAsconEncryption.py - This .py file demonstrates an example of encrypting and decrypting the HEARTBEAT message using the lightweight ASCON encryption scheme. 

guiexample.c - This .c file is an demo created to show the effectiveness of having a password system put in place to connect to a drone

injection.py - This .py file is the code an attacker can use to connect to any UAV drone that uses MAVLink on the attackers network. Must be ran while the drone is in flight.

plan.py - This .py file was the mission flight plan our group used to run our simulation within MAVLink. This code must be run after setting the terminal's initial longitude and latitude.
